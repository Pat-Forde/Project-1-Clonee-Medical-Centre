# Validation Testing 
W3.org validator contact us page missing div closing tag - Fixed
Validator giving error for google maps format.
Added non displayed headers in the hero pics sections to improve accessibillity.

# Lighthouse Testing
The initial lighthouse accessibillity score was in the low 80s and identified that the colour scheme used did not contrast enough. As a result I changed the colour scheme to a darker shade of blue. Lighthouse also identified a missing title in the google map iframe which I added. Lastly lighthouse suggested an issue with the order on the page of h1,h2 headers etc which was also amended to give a 100% score.
